# Welcome to my Passion Project!

## Why did I build this myself instead of using a website builder?

In addition to being a musician, I am a software engineer! The design in my mind's eye was highly specific and I wanted this to be a true reflection of my artistry. Creative, ambitious projects excite me and I thought this would be an excellent way to demonstrate my engineering capabilities while giving myself the musician website of my dreams. 

## How did I build this?

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
